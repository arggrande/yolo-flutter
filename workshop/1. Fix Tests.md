# 1 - Fix our broken tests!

## Themes

- Unit testing

Flutter has its own library for testing called [`flutter_test`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html).

This library contains uses a specialised Widgets and classes for testing, the most important one of these being called [`WidgetTester`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester-class.html). This uses a method called [`pumpWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester/pumpWidget.html), which renders components in memory.

After this, we can use another class called [`CommonFinders`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/CommonFinders-class.html), with a method called [`text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/CommonFinders/text.html), to find a method by the Text rendered in the Element, and will match it according to the [`Matcher`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/findsOneWidget-constant.html) argument passed into the `text` method.

## Steps

1. Remove the current code that is finding the elements from our `flutter create`;
2. Change the test to ensure it can find an Element with the text of `Hello World!`
3. Change the test to ensure it _doesn't_ find an element with the text of `Potatoes!`

## Answer

In `yoloApp\test\widget_test.dart`, modify the following:

```diff

 void main() {
-  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
+  testWidgets('Check hello world smoke test!', (WidgetTester tester) async {
     // Build our app and trigger a frame.
     await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());

     // Verify that our counter starts at 0.
-    expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
-    expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing);
-
-    // Tap the '+' icon and trigger a frame.
-    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add));
-    await tester.pump();
-
-    // Verify that our counter has incremented.
-    expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
-    expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
+    expect(find.text('Hello world!'), findsOneWidget);
+    expect(find.text('Potatoes!'), findsNothing);
   });
 }
```
