## Dependency Management

Dart uses [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) to manage external package dependencies. We can add dependencies to our project a couple of different ways, :

### Directly modifying the file that stores our external dependencies, called the [`pubspec.yaml`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/pubspec) file.

```diff
    ----------------------------------------------
    ... rest of the `pubspec.yaml` file
    ----------------------------------------------
    dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter

        # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
        # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
        cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
+       http: ^0.13.3
+       flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2

    ----------------------------------------------
    ... rest of the `pubspec.yaml` file
    ----------------------------------------------
```

After this you will need to run `flutter pub get` in the `./yoloApp/` directory to ensure the packages are downloaded correctly. If you're using the command line, you wont need to do this step.

### Using the command line utilities that come with Flutter.

Something to keep in mind with Flutter is there are two ways of adding a package to your project on the command line, which will affect how the package is retrieved and integrated in the application. An example of the syntax follows...

### Fetching a dependency for Dart

- Dart: `dart pub add http`

### Fetching a dependency for Flutter.

- Flutter: `flutter pub add http`

This will add the package to your [`pubspec.yaml`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/pubspec) file, and execute a `flutter pub get` command to download the package locally and integrate it with your app.

## Environment Variables

In this workshop, we're using [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) to manage our environment variables at runtime. This reads information out of your `.env` file (there's a `.env.template.txt` file to get you started), and inject the appropriate variables at runtime.

<br/>

## Basic State Management

To create a Widget in Flutter that can handle State, we need to create a Widget that extends the [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) class. Here, you'll get an override for the [`createState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget/createState.html) method, where we'll write up a private class that builds the element with the desired state.

Take note of the convention where an underscore prepends the class/field name, more on this soon.

## Basic HTTP Calls

We wont be wiring up any HTTP calls in this workshop step, but see the docs for the `http` package [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/http-library.html).

It has the usual suspects you'd expect to see in a HTTP package;

- Request/Response classes
- Streamable variants of the Request/Response classese
- The ability to create dedicated custom HTTP Clients (more on this a bit later!)
- A bunch of helper methods

## Dart Language Quirks for private fields/variables

You might notice below in Step 4, we're changing the name of one of our classes to use an `_` as a prefix. As Dart doesnt have any `private`/`protected` style keywords, this convention ensures our class/field/whatever stayes private to the enclosing class.

## Workshop Steps

1. Add the dependencies for `http` and `flutter_dotenv` to your project.
2. Set up your `.env` file with the `API_KEY`, `SEARCH_API` and `USER_API` variables, and add the `.env` file as an asset to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
   - You should only need to change `API_KEY`. I will provide this on the day.
3. Configure `flutter_dotenv`, and log your `API_KEY` to the debug console of VSCode.
4. Change the name of your `MyHomePageState` to `_MyHomePageState`, and update any references accordingly.

## Answer

In `yoloApp\pubspect.yaml`, modify the following:

```diff
    ----------------------------------------------
    ... rest of the `pubspec.yaml` file
    ----------------------------------------------
    dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter

        # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
        # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
        cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
+       http: ^0.13.3
+       flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2

+   assets:
+    - .env
    ----------------------------------------------
    ... rest of the `pubspec.yaml` file
    ----------------------------------------------
```

In `yoloApp/lib/main.dart`, near the top modify the following:

```diff
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
+   import 'package:http/http.dart';
+   import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';
+   import 'dart:developer' as developer;
+
+   Future main() async {
+   // Load our core .env file
+       await dotenv.load(fileName: '.env');
    }
-   void main() {
        runApp(MyApp());
    }
```

In `yoloApp/lib/main.dart`, near the bottom modify the following:

```diff

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
    final String title;

    @override
-   MyHomePageState createState() => MyHomePageState();
+   _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
 }

-   class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
+   class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
+       var x = dotenv.get('API_KEY');
+       developer.log('API_KEY: $x', name: 'yolo.lol');
        return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text(widget.title),
```
