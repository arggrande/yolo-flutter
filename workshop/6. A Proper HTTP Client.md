# Stage 6 - A Proper HTTP Client!

## Themes

- A much cleaner, more extensible use of the `http` library, and the `Client` class that comes with it.

## Clean `http` usage with the `Client` class

This is another refactoring style commit, that cleans up our current usage of the `http` library, and introduces a proper [`Client`](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html) class.

You'd use a dedicated `Client` when you need to maintain persistent connections across multiple requests to the same server.

It's honestly overkill for this workshop, but I think it's worth talking about.

## Workshop Steps

1. Create a new file in `../yoloApp/lib/util/trackerApiClient.dart`
2. Extend and implement the `http.BaseClient` class
3. Create a private method that generates our Auth Headers in a `Map`.
4. Create two methods, `search` and `getuser`, and get them to ping and parse the responses from the appropriate endpoints.
   - Change the `Search` screen to use our new `TrackerApiClient` class, and invoke the `search` method.
