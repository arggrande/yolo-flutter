# Stage 7 - A Details Page with the Collapsible Panel

## ✨ ✨ ✨YOLO ✨ ✨ ✨

By now, you should (hopefully) have a somewhat decent grasp of Flutter and how it works.

I'm not really going to give any context or links for this page, because now is where the fun begins! In the spirit of ✨YOLO ✨ I'll just give you some steps to follow! No solution (though if you're determined you can dig through the git history of this repo). Full YOLO.

Good luck!

## Workshop Steps

1. Create a new Details page, populated with the user Id and steam platform.
2. Use the User Id and Steam Platform to ping the `USER_API` endpoint and get the details and store it in state.
3. Render a simple page with the following;
   - Avatar image of the User
   - A collapsible panel with;
     - Current steam handle
     - Steam ID
