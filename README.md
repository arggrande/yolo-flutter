# YOLO FLUTTER

A YOLO Flutter Workshop!

Here we run some scripts to (hopefully) set everything up correctly. Then we YOLO against some Dart and Flutter.

## Setup

### 1a. Windows installation

As an administrator, run `\windows-setup.ps1` and accept any warnings that get thrown your way.

### 1b. Mac/Linux(?) installation

Run the following run `sudo linux-setup.sh`, and accept any warnings that get thrown your way.

## 2. Env File Setup

Ask Adam for an API key we can use on the day, and put this in a `.env` file at the root of the directory
